goNES allows you to write programs for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).

Benefits of writing NES programs in Golang:

- Code autocompletion support in IDEs
- You can debug code directly from an IDE, it will be executed in the
  built-in Emulator (currently in a rather simple state) 
- Easy unit testing for your code
- Simple code documentation generation

The code for NES programs is written using Aliases for 6502 assembly
instructions, this allows to have full control over the outputted
binary code. The compiler generates an .asm file that can be inspected.

goNES is in an early state of development and needs more work before it
can be used to build a larger project for NES!

## Installation

Install goNES using `go install github.com/retroenv/nesgo/cmd/nesgo@latest`

Install [cc65](https://github.com/cc65/cc65), it is used for generating 
the final .nes file from assembly output generated by goNES.
It is planned to remove this dependency in future versions. 

The integrated OpenGL GUI support is enabled by default. Debugging
your code will execute using the built-in Emulator and GUI.
The GUI modes can be selected using the following build flags:

* `nogui`: disables all GUI modules
* `noopengl` disables the OpenGL GUI
* `sdl` enables the SDL GUI

The following libraries need to be installed, 
depending on the operating system:

**macOS**: `Xcode or Command Line Tools for Xcode (xcode-select --install)`

**Ubuntu/Debian-like**: `build-essential libgl1-mesa-dev xorg-dev`

**CentOS/Fedora-like**: `@development-tools libX11-devel libXcursor-devel
 libXrandr-devel libXinerama-devel mesa-libGL-devel libXi-devel
 libXxf86vm-devel`

**Windows**:
  * Install [msys2](http://www.msys2.org/) 
  * Start msys2 and execute `pacman -S --needed base-devel
    mingw-w64-i686-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
    mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2`
  * Add `c:\tools\msys64\mingw64\bin\` to user path environment variable

## Usage

See one of the examples on how to write code for the NES!

goNES can be used in different ways:

1. Compile a project to a .nes file:
 `gones -f ./examples/blue/main.go -o ./examples/blue/main.nes`

2. Use `go build ./examples/blue/main.go` to compile the program as a
 binary that will execute in the Emulator that gets linked into the
 static binary

3. Run the code in the Emulator using `go run ./examples/blue/main.go`

4. Debug the program using your IDE of choice using the Delve debugger,
 set breakpoints, watch memory or CPU register, execute step by step etc

## Differences / Limitations

* `return` has to be used instead of `rts` - it will get automatically
  added at the end of functions that are not inlined
* `goto` has to be used instead of `jump` - it is limited to the labels in the
  current function as jump destination
* for instructions that accept immediate addressing and zero page
  addressing, an alias function for the addressing mode has to be used,
  for example: `Lda(i uint8)` and
  `LdaAddr(address interface{}, reg ...interface{}`
